# Identify_Q

Matlab code for checking identifiability conditions and performing simulation studies for our paper _Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for the Identifiability of the Q-matrix_, Yuqi Gu and Gongjun Xu (2018+).

<pre>
1. Folder "check_conditions" for checking the proposed identifiability conditions: 
       check_conditions_main.m (main file including several examples)
       check_Theorem1.m  
       check_Theorem2.m  
       check_Theorem3.m  
       check_Theorem4.m  
       check_generic_complete.m (for checking Theorem 5)
       
2. Folder "simulations" for performing simulation studies including:
       simulations in Section 3.1 in the main text;
       simulation studies I-VII in the Supplementary Material.
